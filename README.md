# Basic-Shiny-app
This is a Shiny app displaying COVID cases over time. Users can explore COVID19 confirmed, recovered and death cases, interacting with maps and charts to visualize these indicators by countries.

Following RAP principles, applied renv::init() to initialise environment and also taken a snapshot of the project with renv::snapshot(), once the Shiny app has ran. The entire environment can be replicated just by running renv::restore() after opening the R project file.
